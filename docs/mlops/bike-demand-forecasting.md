# 3 - Bike Demand Forecasting

## ðŸš² Introduction: Forecasting Bike-Sharing Demand and Monitoring Model Performance

In urban environments, bike-sharing systems have emerged as a sustainable and efficient mode of transportation. Accurately predicting bike rental demand is crucial for optimizing operations, ensuring bike availability, and enhancing user satisfaction.

This documentation presents a comprehensive approach to developing and deploying a machine learning model for bike-sharing demand prediction. Drawing inspiration from Analytics Vidhya's end-to-end case study, we delve into data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Beyond model development, maintaining performance in a production environment is vital. Models can degrade over time due to changing data patterns, a phenomenon known as concept drift. To address this, we incorporate monitoring strategies inspired by Evidently AI's tutorial on production model analytics. This includes setting up regular performance checks and generating interactive reports to detect issues proactively.

By following this guide, you'll gain insights into building a robust machine learning pipeline for bike-sharing demand prediction and implementing effective monitoring to ensure sustained model performance in real-world applications.
