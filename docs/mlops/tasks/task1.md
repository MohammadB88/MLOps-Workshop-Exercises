# Clone the Repository & Load and Explore the Data

TODO

### Code
Clone the workshop repository into your environment using the following command in a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/MohammadB88/MLOps-Workshop-Exercises.git
```

Or use the functions provided in the environment, as shown in this image:

### ðŸ”§ Instructions

1. Open and execute the notebooks sequentially from the notebooks/ directory:
    - `01_data_exploration.ipynb` â€“ Explore, clean, and preprocess the dataset.
    - `02_model_training.ipynb` â€“ Train the machine learning model and track experiments with MLflow.
    - `03_model_deployment.ipynb` â€“ Package the trained model, expose it via a REST API, and deploy it in a containerized environment.
    - `04_model_monitoring.ipynb` â€“ Monitor data and model drift using Evidently.

2. Follow the markdown instructions and run each code cell to observe the behavior and flow of data through the pipeline.

3. Take note of the inputs and outputs of each notebook, as these will be important for connecting stages when we later build the full MLOps pipeline.

This guided manual execution lays the groundwork for understanding the lifecycle of ML systems before integrating more advanced practices.
