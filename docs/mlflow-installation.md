# MLflow Installation with helm
In order to install mlflow on OpenShift using helm charts from bitnami, following steps are necessary:

1. Open a terminal on the bastian host or direct connect to a ``"web terminal"`` client on the openshift.

2. Create a namespace/project ``mlflow` in the cluster:
```bash
oc new-project mlflow 
```

3. Add the bitnami charts as a repository:
```bash
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
```

you can check if the repository is correctly added:
```bash
helm repo list
helm rpeo update
```

4. Copy the values of the mlflow charts in a yaml file:
```bash
helm show values bitnami/mlflow > mlflow_values.yaml
```

5. Open the `mlflow_values.yaml` with editor (usually vim/vi):
```bash
vim mlflow_values.yaml
```

edit two parts:

The service type for tracking server is is `LoadBalancer`, which should be ClusterIP (Search for ``"LoadBalancer"`` in the values file you just generated):
```bash
LoadBalancer -> ClusterIP
```

We will later add a route to access the UI of the mlflow tracking server.

Disable the authentification for tracking server (Search for ``"username: user"`` in the values file you just generated):
```bash
enabled: true -> enabled: false
username: user
```

6. Install the MLflow using helm charts and these values:
```bash
helm install mlflow bitnami/mlflow --namespace mlflow --values mlflow_values.yaml
```
