Models can degrade over time due to changing data patterns, a phenomenon known as concept drift. To address this, we incorporate monitoring strategies inspired by Evidently AI's tutorial on production model analytics.

This problem simulates a real-world scenario where the company only has access to historical data from January and February.

Since the model is trained only on winter data (January and February), its performance may gradually deteriorate as new, unseen seasonal patterns emerge.
